# Message Mixer
## About
This project is part of the Back End Career Path on Codecademy. The project provides the user with the ability to encode and decode messages using a module containing 3 cipher functions: a 'caesarCipher', a 'symbolCipher', and a 'reverse Cipher'.

## Functionality
- The encryptors.js file contains the 3 different cipher functions which are used by the other files to perform their operations.
- The message-mixer.js file contains code that allows a user to choose one of the three ciphers to encode or decode a message that will be provided by the user.
- The super-encoder.js file contains code that encodes or decodes a message using all the three ciphers synchronously.

## Comments
- This project enlightned me about the importance of modules and brought me close to a somewhat real life situation where using modules would be immensely beneficial.
- Modules indeed help with managing code and debugging. It also makes it possible to make code available to other programs and this greatly increases the range of things that can be accomplished.
- Overall, I really enjoyed completing this project even though it was quite straight forward.
